# amr_bacteria
In this project, we downloaded all bacterial reference genomes from NCBI and detected the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes present in them. We then clustered the bacteria based on their similarity in AMR gene composition, aiming to identify bacterial communities with highly similar AMR profiles.
